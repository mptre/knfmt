Improvements
============

* More efficient allocation of tokens inside lexer_emit(). Use a vector of
  tokens. However this vector can never be reallocated.

* Simplify or strict mode which mutates the code:
  - Group and sort stack variables according to style(9)
  - Group and sort includes
  - Align backslashes in cpp define
  - Remove parenthesis around return expression
  - Remove semicolon after blocks wrapped in braces

* Handle assembler:
