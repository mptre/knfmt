Bugs
====

* Alignment spills over disjoint block if at least one block is nested inside
  preprocessor directives. token_has_line() does not see the hard line since
  it's part of the verbatim (cpp) token hanging of as a prefix on the following
  token.

	#if 1
	struct foo *s;
	#endif

	int x;

  It might be helpful if the trailing hard line part of the verbatim cpp token
  was emitted as a separate verbatim token.

Improvements
============

* More efficient allocation of tokens inside lexer_emit(). Use a vector of
  tokens. However this vector can never be reallocated.

* Simplify or strict mode which mutates the code:
  - Group and sort stack variables according to style(9)
  - Group and sort includes
  - Align backslashes in cpp define
  - Remove parenthesis around return expression
  - Remove semicolon after blocks wrapped in braces
